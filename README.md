# not-marble-blast
A small clone of Marble Blast made in Unity.

This is a personal project I made during my senior year of high school for an independent study. I started by learning C# and how it differed from Python (the only other language I knew at the time), and then started learning Unity to apply what I had learned of C#. This game grew out of me just messing around with using physics to move a ball around, which gave me the inspiration to make a clone of Marble Blast, an older 3D platformer in the same vein. This turned out to be an ideal choice, as I learned I could easily come up with a new idea, implement, and test it all within a time frame of an hour or two. The primary elements of Unity that I learned here were physics, menus/UI, coroutines, and general Unity practices. Since the focus of this project was on coding, I did neglect other areas of game design, namely art, sound, and level design, which I may revisit in the future. Otherwise, I'm happy with where this project currently stands and I hope anyone who sees this tries it out, or at least finds it interesting!

A Windows build of the game can be found on the [Releases page](https://github.com/Nethermaker/not-marble-blast/releases).
